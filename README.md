# 04-Pandas-Challenge
pandas challenge: Heroes of Pymoli
Jeremy Hamley - June 2020

This Pandas Challenge uses the Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook to analyze in-game puchase data from the game "Heroes of Pymoli."
The exact instructions (copied and pasted from the Tilogy Education homework assignment) are listed below for reference.
The final analysis of purchase data will be displayed within Jupyter Notebook.


Based on the final analysis, I can note the following three purchasing trends for the game Heroes of Pymoli:

 - Female and other/non-disclosed players are more likely than male players to purchase an item in the game.  
And, for the purchases that female and other/non-disclosed players make, the purchase price for each item is higher on average than the purchase price for item purchased by males.
      -Females players made an average of 1.40 purchases per female player with an average purchase price of $3.20 per purchase.
      -Other/non-disclosed players made an average of 1.36 purchases per other/non-disclosed player with an average purchase price of $3.35 per purchase.
      -Male players made an average of 1.35 purchases per male player with an average purchase price of $3.02 per purchase.
      
 - The majority of players fall within the age group 20-24 (45% of players) and are the most likely group to purchase a item in the game.  
 On average, the purchase price for players age 20-24 matches average purchase price for all players across the entire game.
       -Players within the age group 20-24 made an average of 1.41 purchases per player with an average purchase price of $3.05 per purchase.
       -The age group with the highest purchase average is players aged 35-39 - this group has an average purchase price of $3.60 per purchase.
       
 - The most popular and the most profitable item is the Final Critic.  The Final Critic was purchased more often than any other item and produced more revenue than any other item.
 The purchase price for the Final Critic was among the highest priced items.  The purchase price for items range between $1.00 and $4.99 per purchase.  
 The purchase price for the Final Critic averaged at $4.61 per purchase.  So, the higher price was not a deterrent.

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
Your final report should include each of the following:

### Player Count
* Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics
* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

### Age Demographics
* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders
* Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * SN
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Most Popular Items
* Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Most Profitable Items
* Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value

As final considerations:

* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* See [Example Solution](HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb) for a reference on expected format.
